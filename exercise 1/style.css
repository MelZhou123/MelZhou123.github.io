/* I chose the chosen image because I felt like it was my type of style-Japanese manga style */

/* I also felt like the CSS border style of solid was most appealing to me because it is a neat and clean aesthetic.*/

/* I selected the pastel colors of pink and blue because they emulate the qualities of delicate, feminine and clean which is what I would describe my artistic style to be.*/
