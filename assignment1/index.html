<h2>Week 2</h2>


<h3 class="small"> 
        1) Spend two minutes with the experience and list all of your actions in granular detail.

</h3>




<p class="small"> 

        1. Open the website link in a new browser.
</p>




<p class="small">
        2.Click through the different instructions, from steps one to four.
</p>




<p class="small"> 
        3. Redirected and brought into the main page where you can see a sea water background which changes according to the time of the day. Essentially meaning it has a day and night mode.

</p>




<p class="small">
       4. Firstly, I used the computer mouse to spread sand into the bottom of the fish tank located on the bottom of the webpage. Secondly, I spread some algae and lastly I added a few fish to the fish tank during the duration of two minutes. There is a clear/reset selection icon if you wish to reconstruct your customised fish tank.

</p>



<p class="small">    
        
        5. Selecting the info icon to get a digitally written introductory paragraph as to what the web designer's intentions were when constructing and coding this web page.

</p>



<h3 class="small">

        2) What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?

</h3>




<p class="small"> 

        The ability for the background seawater to change from day to night time, the day time and night time aesthetic the web designer has cleverly coded.
</p>



<h3 class="small">
        3) What did you spend the most time engaging with?
</h3>



    <p class="small">

        I spent the most time with engaging with the materials that were necessary to make a complete an aesthetic fish tank.

    </p>




<h3 class="small">  

        4) What was the most common action in your two minute interaction with the experience?

</h3>



        <p class="small">

            The most common action in my two minute interaction with the experience was adding fish and sand to the fish tank. 
        </p>




<h3 class="small">

        5) What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?
</h3>




<p class="small">

        My impression of what the intended primary goal of the interactive experience is to create an interactive experience for users to know what it feels like to raise a pet gold fish through a digital screen, before they decide to raise one in real life or just purely because they wanted to test out this simulation.
</p>



<h3 class="small">

        6) How does the experience communicate its' primary goal?
</h3> 




 <p class="small">

        The experience communicates its' primary goal via the info icon located on the webpage which gives an informative run down of what the creator's intentions were behind the website.
 </p>




<h3 class="small">

        7) What is your impression of the intended length of a single interaction and how often you are intended to interact with the experience?     

</h3>



<p class="small">

        My impression of the intended length of the single interaction is minimum three minutes and maximum five minute.  It it suspected you would interact with the experience maybe once or twice out of curiosity maybe once a week to relieve boredom or stress.
</p>



<h2>Week 3</h2>


<h3 class="small">

       8) What metaphor or metaphors does the experience's mental model reference?
</h3>


<p class="small">

        The metaphors the experience's mental model references includes: a place (a fish tank), circumstance or environment which has little or no privacy. Another one is that humans are all immersed in a paradigm and for majority of humans it is difficult to distinguish ourselves from our thoughts about the way we learn.
</p>


<h3 class="small">

        9) What does this reference suggest about how you should feel and/or act when engaging with it?

</h3>


<p class="small">  
        
        This reference suggests that fish should be given some level of privacy when they are enjoying their tank life. It also suggests that you should have more indepth thoughts about the way you arrange your fish tank when you are arranging it.</p>
<p>

<h3 class="small">

        10) What is the most frustrating element of the interaction and what makes it frustrating to you?
</h3>
       
<p class="small">

        The most frustrating element of the interaction is the pixalated nature of all the graphics on the screen, after an extended period of looking at the screen you start to feel dizzy.
</p>



<h3 class="small">

        11) What is the most satisfying element of the interaction and what makes it satisfying to you?

       
</h3>



        
<p class="small">

        The fact that you can reset your creation so if you make a mistake in your fish bowl creation, you are not restricted to just sticking with a creation that is not suitable to your aesthetic.
